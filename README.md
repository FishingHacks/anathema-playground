# Anathema Playground

A Playground to play around with anathema templates

Usage: Run the program in the root of the directory or download one of the releases. `-h` and `--help` will bring up a help menu. By default, the playground uses a temporary file, however if you want to save your changes you can specify a file.

> **Note**: Anathema Playground only saves when you run your code.

As of right now, anathema playground uses the new `State` derive macros that are not yet merged into the dev branch. Use a local install of anathema with that feature in it: https://github.com/FishingHacks/anathema
